Business Problem: Confidence in Customer Ratings
Problem: A recent survey of 100 customers gave a mean satisfaction rating of 4.1 out of 5 stars, with a standard deviation of 0.5. We need to tell the CEO, with 95% certainty, the range where the true average satisfaction score of all customers likely lies.
Task: Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean rating

x=4.1
n=100
sd=0.5
prob=95
z=norm.ppf(1-((100-prob)/(2*100)))
z=1.96

C_I1=x+z*(sd/(n**0.5))
print(C_I1)

C_I2=x-z*(sd/(n**0.5))
print(C_I2)

Final 95% Confidence Interval:
(4.002, 4.198)
