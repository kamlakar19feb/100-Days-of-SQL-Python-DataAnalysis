Scenario: You are analyzing website user behavior and A/B test results.
1. Business Problem: A/B Testing Foundation
Problem: Explain the fundamental concept we rely on in statistics to be confident that our small test samples (like an A/B test group of 100 users) can accurately represent the behavior of the entire website population (millions of users).
Task: Explain the Central Limit Theorem in simple terms and why it is critical for reliable business analysis.

The Central limit theorem says that if you take many random samples from any population (no matter how the original data looks - skewed, uniform or irregular), the average mean of these samples will form a normal (bell shaped) distribution as the sample size gets larger

Why It’s Critical for Business Analysis:

Predictability: It allows analysts to make accurate predictions about populations using sample data.

Confidence Intervals: It’s the foundation for calculating margins of error and confidence levels.

Decision-Making: Businesses can test hypotheses (like “Did sales increase after a campaign?”) even without studying every customer.

Reliability: It ensures statistical results are stable and trustworthy when based on large enough samples.
