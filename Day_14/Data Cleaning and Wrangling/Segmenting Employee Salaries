Business Problem: Segmenting Employee Salaries
Problem: HR wants to analyze how different salary brackets correlate with employee retention, but they need the numerical salary data categorized into meaningful groups.
Task: Create a new column named Salary_Bracket that classifies salaries into three groups: "Low" (< $50k), "Medium" ($50k - $80k), and "High" (> $80k).

df['Salary_Bracket']=np.where(df['Salary']>80000,'High', np.where((df['Salary'] >= 50000) & (df['Salary'] <= 80000),'Medium', 'Low'))
print(df)
