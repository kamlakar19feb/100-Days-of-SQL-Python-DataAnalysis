Problem: Management needs a clear, ranked list of salaries within each department to visualize compensation hierarchy.
Task: Generate a report that ranks employees within each department based on their salary, from highest to lowest paid (rank 1 is highest paid in each department)

SELECT
	e.Name as Emp_Name
	d.DeptName as Department_Name
	e.Salary as Salary
	Dense_Rank() over (Partition by d.DeptName Order By Salary DESC ) as Rank_in_Dept
FROM
	Employees e
	Inner Join
	Departments d
	ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID
